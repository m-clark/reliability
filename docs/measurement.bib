	abstract = {This book introduces the reader to the main quantitative concepts, methods, and computational techniques needed for the development, evaluation, and application of tests in the behavioral/social sciences, including educational tests. Two empirical examples are carried throughout to illustrate alternative methods. Other data sets are used for special illustrations. Self-contained programs for confirmatory and exploratory factor analysis are available on the Web. Intended for students of psychology, particularly educational psychology, as well as social science students interested in how tests are constructed and used, prerequisites include a course on statistics. The programs and data files for this book can be downloaded from www.psypress.com/test-theory/},

For each method, we discuss the rationale, the estimation of reliability, and the goodness of fit of the model that defines the reliability coefficient to the data. Similarities and differences in the three approaches are highlighted. Finally, we provide a computational example using generated data to illustrate the differences among the different reliability methods.},
