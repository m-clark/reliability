	abstract = {This book introduces the reader to the main quantitative concepts, methods, and computational techniques needed for the development, evaluation, and application of tests in the behavioral/social sciences, including educational tests. Two empirical examples are carried throughout to illustrate alternative methods. Other data sets are used for special illustrations. Self-contained programs for confirmatory and exploratory factor analysis are available on the Web. Intended for students of psychology, particularly educational psychology, as well as social science students interested in how tests are constructed and used, prerequisites include a course on statistics. The programs and data files for this book can be downloaded from www.psypress.com/test-theory/},

Yet, results of our literature review, including more than 10,000 articles published in 15 journals from January 2001 and December 2010, indicate that Bayesian approaches are essentially absent from the organizational sciences. Our article introduces organizational science researchers to Bayesian methods and describes why and how they should be used. We use multiple linear regression as the framework to offer a step-by-step demonstration, including the use of software, regarding how to implement Bayesian methods. We explain and illustrate how to determine the prior distribution, compute the posterior distribution, possibly accept the null value, and produce a write-up describing the entire Bayesian process, including graphs, results, and their interpretation. We also offer a summary of the advantages of using Bayesian analysis and examples of how specific published research based on frequentist analysis-based approaches failed to benefit from the advantages offered by a Bayesian approach and how using Bayesian analyses would have led to richer and, in some cases, different substantive conclusions. We hope that our article will serve as a catalyst for the adoption of Bayesian methods in organizational science research.},

	abstract = {Sample coefficient alpha is commonly reported for psychological measurement scales. However, how to characterize the distribution of sample coefficient alpha with the Likert-type scales typically used in social and behavioral science research is not clear. Using the Hopkins Symptom Checklist, the authors compare three characterizations of the distribution of the sample coefficient alpha: the existing normal-theory-based distribution, a newly proposed distribution based on fourth-order moments, and the bootstrap empirical distribution. Their study indicates that the normal-theory-based distribution has a systematic bias in describing the behavior of the sample coefficient alpha. The distribution based on fourth-order moments is better than the normal-theory-based one but is still not good enough with finite samples. The bootstrap automatically takes the sampling distribution and sample size into account; thus it is recommended for characterizing the behavior of sample coefficient alpha with Likert-type scales.},

This paper sum marizes the important aspects of the sampling theory for Cronbach's (1951) coefficient alpha, a widely used internal consistency coefficient. This theory enables researchers to test a specific numerical hypothesis about the population alpha and to obtain confidence intervals for the population coefficient. It also permits researchers to test the hypothesis of equality among several coefficients, either under the condition of inde pendent samples or when the same sample has been used for all measurements. The procedures are illus trated numerically, and the assumptions and deriva tions underlying the theory are discussed.},
