	abstract = {A composite score is the sum of a set of components. For example, a total test score can be defined as the sum of the individual items. The reliability of composite scores is of interest in a wide variety of contexts due to their widespread use and applicability to many disciplines. The psychometric literature has devoted considerable time to discussing how to best estimate the population reliability value. However, all point estimates of a reliability coefficient fail to convey the uncertainty associated with the estimate as it estimates the population value. Correspondingly, a confidence interval is recommended to convey the uncertainty with which the population value of the reliability coefficient has been estimated. However, many confidence interval methods for bracketing the population reliability coefficient exist and it is not clear which method is most appropriate in general or in a variety of specific circumstances. We evaluate these confidence interval methods for 4 reliability coefficients (coefficient alpha, coefficient omega, hierarchical omega, and categorical omega) under a variety of conditions with 3 large-scale Monte Carlo simulation studies. Our findings lead us to generally recommend bootstrap confidence intervals for hierarchical omega for continuous items and categorical omega for categorical items. All of the methods we discuss are implemented in the freely available R language and environment via the MBESS package. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

However, how to characterize the distribution of sample coefficient alpha with the Likert-type scales typically used in social and behavioral science research is not clear. Using the Hopkins Symptom Checklist, the authors compare three characterizations of the distribution of the sample coefficient alpha: the existing normal-theory-based distribution, a newly proposed distribution based on fourth-order moments, and the bootstrap empirical distribution. Their study indicates that the normal-theory-based distribution has a systematic bias in describing the behavior of the sample coefficient alpha. The distribution based on fourth-order moments is better than the normal-theory-based one but is still not good enough with finite samples. The bootstrap automatically takes the sampling distribution and sample size into account; thus it is recommended for characterizing the behavior of sample coefficient alpha with Likert-type scales.},

Our article introduces organizational science researchers to Bayesian methods and describes why and how they should be used. We use multiple linear regression as the framework to offer a step-by-step demonstration, including the use of software, regarding how to implement Bayesian methods. We explain and illustrate how to determine the prior distribution, compute the posterior distribution, possibly accept the null value, and produce a write-up describing the entire Bayesian process, including graphs, results, and their interpretation. We also offer a summary of the advantages of using Bayesian analysis and examples of how specific published research based on frequentist analysis-based approaches failed to benefit from the advantages offered by a Bayesian approach and how using Bayesian analyses would have led to richer and, in some cases, different substantive conclusions. We hope that our article will serve as a catalyst for the adoption of Bayesian methods in organizational science research.},

Specifically, whereas there are conditions under which α, β, and ω h are equivalent to each other and to one of the two conceptualizations of reliability considered here, we show that equality with this conceptualization of reliability and between α and ω h holds only under a highly restrictive set of conditions and that the conditions under which β equals ω h are only somewhat more general.

	abstract = {Composite measures play an important role in psychology and related disciplines. Composite measures almost always have error. Correspondingly, it is important to understand the reliability of the scores from any particular composite measure. However, the point estimates of the reliability of composite measures are fallible and thus all such point estimates should be accompanied by a confidence interval. When confidence intervals are wide, there is much uncertainty in the population value of the reliability coefficient. Given the importance of reporting confidence intervals for estimates of reliability, coupled with the undesirability of wide confidence intervals, we develop methods that allow researchers to plan sample size in order to obtain narrow confidence intervals for population reliability coefficients. We first discuss composite reliability coefficients and then provide a discussion on confidence interval formation for the corresponding population value. Using the accuracy in parameter estimation approach, we develop two methods to obtain accurate estimates of reliability by planning sample size. The first method provides a way to plan sample size so that the expected confidence interval width for the population reliability coefficient is sufficiently narrow. The second method ensures that the confidence interval width will be sufficiently narrow with some desired degree of assurance (e.g., 99\% assurance that the 95\% confidence interval for the population reliability coefficient will be less than W units wide). The effectiveness of our methods was verified with Monte Carlo simulation studies. We demonstrate how to easily implement the methods with easy-to-use and freely available software.},

The most commonly used reliability estimate of a composite score is coefficient α. However, under regularity conditions, the population value of coefficient α is only a lower bound on the population reliability, unless the items are essentially τ-equivalent, an assumption that is likely violated in most applications. A generalization of coefficient α, termed ω, is discussed and generally recommended. Furthermore, a point estimate itself almost certainly differs from the population value. Therefore, it is important to provide confidence interval limits so as not to overinterpret the point estimate. Analytic and bootstrap methods are described in detail for confidence interval construction for ω. We go on to recommend the bias-corrected bootstrap approach for ω and provide open source and freely available R functions via the MBESS package to implement the methods discussed.},
