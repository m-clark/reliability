Yet, results of our literature review, including more than 10,000 articles published in 15 journals from January 2001 and December 2010, indicate that Bayesian approaches are essentially absent from the organizational sciences. Our article introduces organizational science researchers to Bayesian methods and describes why and how they should be used. We use multiple linear regression as the framework to offer a step-by-step demonstration, including the use of software, regarding how to implement Bayesian methods. We explain and illustrate how to determine the prior distribution, compute the posterior distribution, possibly accept the null value, and produce a write-up describing the entire Bayesian process, including graphs, results, and their interpretation. We also offer a summary of the advantages of using Bayesian analysis and examples of how specific published research based on frequentist analysis-based approaches failed to benefit from the advantages offered by a Bayesian approach and how using Bayesian analyses would have led to richer and, in some cases, different substantive conclusions. We hope that our article will serve as a catalyst for the adoption of Bayesian methods in organizational science research.},

	abstract = {Sample coefficient alpha is commonly reported for psychological measurement scales. However, how to characterize the distribution of sample coefficient alpha with the Likert-type scales typically used in social and behavioral science research is not clear. Using the Hopkins Symptom Checklist, the authors compare three characterizations of the distribution of the sample coefficient alpha: the existing normal-theory-based distribution, a newly proposed distribution based on fourth-order moments, and the bootstrap empirical distribution. Their study indicates that the normal-theory-based distribution has a systematic bias in describing the behavior of the sample coefficient alpha. The distribution based on fourth-order moments is better than the normal-theory-based one but is still not good enough with finite samples. The bootstrap automatically takes the sampling distribution and sample size into account; thus it is recommended for characterizing the behavior of sample coefficient alpha with Likert-type scales.},

This theory enables researchers to test a specific numerical hypothesis about the population alpha and to obtain confidence intervals for the population coefficient. It also permits researchers to test the hypothesis of equality among several coefficients, either under the condition of inde pendent samples or when the same sample has been used for all measurements. The procedures are illus trated numerically, and the assumptions and deriva tions underlying the theory are discussed.},

	abstract = {A composite score is the sum of a set of components. For example, a total test score can be defined as the sum of the individual items. The reliability of composite scores is of interest in a wide variety of contexts due to their widespread use and applicability to many disciplines. The psychometric literature has devoted considerable time to discussing how to best estimate the population reliability value. However, all point estimates of a reliability coefficient fail to convey the uncertainty associated with the estimate as it estimates the population value. Correspondingly, a confidence interval is recommended to convey the uncertainty with which the population value of the reliability coefficient has been estimated. However, many confidence interval methods for bracketing the population reliability coefficient exist and it is not clear which method is most appropriate in general or in a variety of specific circumstances. We evaluate these confidence interval methods for 4 reliability coefficients (coefficient alpha, coefficient omega, hierarchical omega, and categorical omega) under a variety of conditions with 3 large-scale Monte Carlo simulation studies. Our findings lead us to generally recommend bootstrap confidence intervals for hierarchical omega for continuous items and categorical omega for categorical items. All of the methods we discuss are implemented in the freely available R language and environment via the MBESS package. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},
